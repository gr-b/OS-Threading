For Operating System - WPI A16
Project 4

This project implements a dummy operation that requires processing an entire file. The purpose is to test if threading can be used to make this operation faster. The findings were that the optimal number of threads is about 2 times the number of cores on the computer. The tests were performed on CPUs that support 2 threads per core, so this result is as expected.
